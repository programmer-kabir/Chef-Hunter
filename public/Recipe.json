      "description":"In 1948, when Paul was reassigned to the U.S. Information Service at the American Embassy in Paris, the Childs moved to France. While there, Child developed a penchant for French cuisine and attended the world-famous Cordon Bleu cooking school. Following her six-month training — which included private lessons with master chef Max Bugnard — Child banded with fellow Cordon Bleu students Simone Beck and Louisette Bertholle to form the cooking school L'Ecole de Trois Gourmandes (The School of the Three Gourmands).",

      "description": "The New York Police Department has investigated three sexual assault complaints against Batali but those cases were later closed due to expiration of the statute of limitations and a lack of evidence. Batali was found not guilty in one instance of indecent assault and battery at a trial in Boston last year. In 2022, the debate over Batali’s misconduct and ramifications reignited following the release of the documentary Batali: The Fall of a Superstar on Discovery Plus.",

      "description": "If there's one thing you can say about Ina Garten, it's that she is always up for a new challenge. In fact, she lives for it, as the success of her store soon showed others. Garten had built Barefoot Contessa into a hugely successful business. It became so busy that, in 1985, she moved the store from its original 400-square-foot building in Westhampton to a new 3,000-square-foot store in East Hampton (via Eater). But, after nearly two decades of running her popular shop, Garten was looking to do something new. I like a nice project that I can chew on,And so the store was that, and then after twenty years, it was time to do something else.",

Somebody asked me why I don't wear contact lenses but it's all thanks to an incident on a lads ski trip in Switzerland. After a day on the Swiss slopes, the apres ski antics got slightly out of hand in the Blumenthal log cabin.I was with a really good mix of people and we ended up in a drunken play fight. It was like something out of Bottom.My mate, who was an ex Arsenal player, had a toilet roll in his mouth and leaned back to grab a toilet brush and tap me on the head. It wasn't hard but my glasses fell off and it went in my eye.",
